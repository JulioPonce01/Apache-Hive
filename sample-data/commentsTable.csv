BTW O() is the asymptotic upper bound to the growth of execution time of an algorithm with respect to the input size (n). So, O(n) means that the execution time grows at most as n grows (plus constants).;5190

2486;2008-09-11 16:57:23.940;56930;0;9:5 is not a valid time representation. Must be 9:05 or something like that.;4833
2487;2008-09-11 16:59:18.443;56873;0;Yeesh.  Personally, I believe this is ass backwards.  Interfaces should hold the bare minimum functionality for a type, and base classes should provide a rich framework upon which customization can be built.  Put that in an interface and you just made it very hard to implement.;1228

2492;2008-09-11 17:08:30.823;57084;1;You can't have 2 indexers 'this', but you can have a 'string IDataErrorInfo.this' and a 'T IList<T>.this'. You'll have to cast the object before accessing the indexer, but it works.;5834
2493;2008-09-11 17:10:37.060;57054;0;May I ask how you're serializing a custom indexer? When I've tried to index a custom indexer (for WCF), I get an ASP yellow-screen-of-death message saying that custom indexers cannot be serialized. I eventually just gave up on the idea.;5834

However, you can take a Java class and discover what methods it has or what annotations exist for its functions, etc.  Just be prepared to write 20-30 lines of code to do what Python could do in 1-5 lines of code.;1694

4286;2008-09-14 02:28:40.353;60891;2;You have to be careful about your conclusion here. Even a very small leak can cause massive fragmentation of the heap. Think of each 1-byte  leak malloc() that is not freed as bullet hole in the heap. The blocks  immediately adjacent can never coalesce.;1553
4287;2008-09-14 02:33:32.430;60966;0;I disagree with this idea. Increasing the size of all allocations creates INTERNAL fragmentation.

16076;2008-09-19 01:10:15.757;98522;0;When we do this, we usually use some feature of the database to produce the value, so it is one query instead of O(n).;5338

16078;2008-09-19 01:11:00.747;98522;0;@Eli: Yes, look at my answer just below this one.;781
16081;2008-09-19 01:11:44.550;98502;0;That would be unlikely. It depends on the randomness of the generated account number and the number of active accounts. With managed code you have to recurse 10s of thousands of times in order to break the stack. When the probability of non-uniqueness approaches 10,000:1, then it's time to worry.;332
16082;2008-09-19 01:13:11.770;98559;1;what language is this?  How about a tag for the language?;1190
16083;2008-09-19 01:13:52.877;76724;0;For this class of problem it's a good idea to specify the RDBMS. Oracle can use solutions that SQL Server can't and vis-a-versa.;4134
16085;2008-09-19 01:15:19.050;98522;0;In my opinion this solution is no better, the stack overflow issue is not a serious concern.  Also, hash tables and dictionaries have this exact same problem, perhaps you should investigate those solutions as well (hint, the solutions may seem familiar).;332
16086;2008-09-19 01:15:22.403;98471;0;I totally agree, There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the collection base.;2194
16087;2008-09-19 01:15:40.890;98553;0;"That is not exactly correct. You can use random access to arbitrarily read and write a file (in bytes) from any point. However, its up to you to shift the file offsets when inserting something.

In other words, its simpler to just regenerate the file.";1965
16088;2008-09-19 01:15:53.637;98522;0;I frankly agree that random generation with collision testing is a bad idea -- see my post-script -- but it's a bad idea independent of the bad idea that is needless recursion.;13600

But if you write at that point, you'll overwrite what was previously at that location.

16310;2008-09-19 02:54:21.653;99065;0;You aren't limited to ASHX with the handler implementation, you can group handlers in class files and add the handlers to your webconfig.
